The Adventures of Pirate Pete
=============================

!["Screenshot"](http://eddmorgan.com/misc/pirate-pete-screenshot.png)

Not gonna lie, this is a pretty bad game. But it's built in Ruby, and it's much more fun to work on than to play.

It's a simple platformer, what with the jumping and the enemies and swinging on vines and stuff. Hit the **H** key in-game for controls.

Please, go ahead and fork this. It'll be nice if you opened a pull request back here though, just for my own education.

Dependencies
